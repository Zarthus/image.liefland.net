# Installation

Ensure you have PHP >= 7.2 on your server (7.1 should work too, but is untested.)

- Copy `config/config.dist.php` to `config/config.php` and edit it.
- Follow the instructions from `setup.md` for your webserver setup.
- Follow instructions from `sharex_config.md` to set up ShareX to upload to your service.
- Ensure `images/` has the right access for your httpd user.
- Upload an image.
